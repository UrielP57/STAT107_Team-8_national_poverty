# STAT107_PHC_Donnie_Marianne_Uriel

## Introduction: 
The purpose of this experiment was to create and train a model to not only establish a connection between the Poverty headcount ratio and Inflation. But potential create a means to see trends that will eventually help foresee potential spikes of inflation worldwide. This analysis should be to benefit government institutions that not only track but try to influence how much inflation would inflict upon society as a whole. This would implicate federal policies that end up being passed or killed in the senate. Which in turn would affect local business all the way to international ones.

## Question: 
Is there a statistically significant correlation between inflation rates and the Poverty headcount ratio across countries worldwide?

## Plan: 
We hope to answer our hypothesis since, if we are able to establish a connection between inflation to PHC. Then going forward it would be possible to train a model that could potential forecast the trends of inflation which would help government bodies worldwide create plans to counteract these shifts. 

## Data: 
The data that is available is NEW_DDAY (Poverty Head Count at $3.00 a day (2021 PPP)), API_1 and API_2 are from the same data set (Inflation consumer prices (annual %) for the World, Grow (Population growth (annual%)). However API_2 is less about data and more of the information it can present since it contains notes left behind from the makers of the csv file. 

## Cleaning the Data: 
For each of the three data sets, it was needed to recreate a data frame since the original csv file showed each excel file to have their rows and columns in the wrong place. Since basic R function like summary() or mean() would grab information from the file's columns, it would output an answer. However the number results would be wrong since it would be grabbing all 270 countries info for 1960.
